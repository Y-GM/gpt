Mu Bai, it's written in the stars.

32
00:02:09.392 --> 00:02:10.592 line:-3
Don't blame yourself.

33
00:02:12.496 --> 00:02:13.232 line:-3
How could it be?

34
00:02:13.232 --> 00:02:14.016 line:-3
It's the domain.

35
00:02:14.016 --> 00:02:15.072 line:-3
The tables have turned.

36
00:02:15.072 --> 00:02:17.456 line:-4
It won't be good for our relationship
if we continue to fight.

37
00:02:17.456 --> 00:02:18.576 line:-3
Let's sue for peace.

38
00:02:18.576 --> 00:02:22.000 line:-3
Nothing is impossible in this world.

39
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.952 line:-3
Your Holiness, everything is ready.

40
00:02:25.952 --> 00:02:27.047 line:-3
Hurry up, report to Tribe Chief.

41
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.968 line:-3
Yes.

42
00:02:28.688 --> 00:02:32.280 line:-3
Clumsy. Always drop the ball.

43
00:02:33.072 --> 00:02:35.424 line:-3
Plan changed. Attack.

00:02:35.424 --> 00:02:36.400 line:-3

Kill them all.

Come on!

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.424 line:-4
-Go over there, follow me.
-Someone is attacking us. Hurry up.

56
00:04:23.424 --> 00:04:25.584 line:-4
-Someone is attacking us. Hurry up.
-Over there.

57
00:04:44.544 --> 00:04:49.600 line:-3
Destruction. How exhilarating!

Fourth soul skill, Bone Jail.

62
00:06:14.416 --> 00:06:17.920 line:-4
I didn’t expect my dad to come right after
Brother San left.

63
00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.832 line:-3
What brings Chief Ning here at this time?

64
00:06:20.832 --> 00:06:22.928 line:-3
I have no idea either.

65
00:06:33.184 --> 00:06:36.560 line:-3
Dad, Grandpa Bone, what happened?

66
00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.912 line:-3
Qibao Amber Tribe

67
00:06:46.032 --> 00:06:47.600 line:-3
has been destroyed.

68
00:06:54.352 --> 00:06:58.800 line:-3
Last night, Qibao Amber Tribe was attacked.

69
00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.632 line:-4
The battle lasted for four hours.
Our loss was disastrous.

70
00:07:04.208 --> 00:07:08.048 line:-3
Over two thirds of our disciples perished.

71
00:07:08.048 --> 00:07:11.472 line:-3
The casualties are still rising.

72
00:07:11.472 --> 00:07:14.640 line:-4
We keep hearing of the deaths
of the disciples outside.

73
00:08:32.448 --> 00:08:35.024 line:-3
They got the perfect timing.

74
00:08:35.024 --> 00:08:39.280 line:-3
40% of our disciples were working outside

75
00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.864 line:-3
while our internal fort was empty.

76
00:08:40.864 --> 00:08:43.168 line:-4
If it weren't for the night patrol
who warned everyone in time

77
00:08:43.168 --> 00:08:45.472 line:-3
and the hidden weapon provided by Tang San,

78
00:08:45.472 --> 00:08:47.696 line:-3
we might have been wiped out.

79
00:08:49.296 --> 00:08:51.632 line:-3
Dad, how could this happen?

80
00:08:51.632 --> 00:08:53.952 line:-3
Which force can be so powerful?

81
00:08:53.952 --> 00:08:56.336 line:-3
It couldn't be other tribes.

82
00:08:56.336 --> 00:08:58.544 line:-3
Was it them?

83
00:09:00.224 --> 00:09:02.320 line:-3
Besides Martial Soul Hall,

84
00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:05.440 line:-3
who could possess such tremendous power?

85
00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:08.144 line:-4
They not only mobilized
their subordinate soul masters,

86
00:09:08.144 --> 00:09:09.808 line:-3
but also those of the Lower Four.

87
00:09:09.808 --> 00:09:13.472 line:-4
There were four Grand Soul Land Masters
among the attackers last night.

88
00:09:13.472 --> 00:09:15.728 line:-4
If it weren't for
Uncle Bone and Uncle Sword...

89
00:09:18.016 --> 00:09:20.320 line:-3
Grandpa Bone, your hand...

90
00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.664 line:-3
Nothing. It'll recover in a few days.

91
00:09:23.664 --> 00:09:26.864 line:-3
But Chen Xin, that old fellow...

92
00:09:26.864 --> 00:09:28.896 line:-3
What's wrong with Grandpa Sword?

93
00:09:28.896 --> 00:09:31.440 line:-3
Uncle Sword was severely injured in the fight.

94
00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.136 line:-4
Three of the Grand Soul Land Masters
were greatly hurt by him

95
00:09:33.136 --> 00:09:34.921 line:-3
and were then forced to retreat.

96
00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.072 line:-3
But he lost his right arm.

97
00:09:41.456 --> 00:09:45.088 line:-3
Luckily, he survived.

98
00:09:45.088 --> 00:09:46.992 line:-3
Currently, he's hanging on

99
00:09:46.992 --> 00:09:50.768 line:-4
to escort the evacuation
of the remaining disciples and supplies.

100
00:09:50.768 --> 00:09:52.496 line:-3
Martial Soul Hall is so cruel.

101
00:09:52.496 --> 00:09:54.032 line:-3
It seems that they're determined to win.

102
00:09:54.032 --> 00:09:56.288 line:-3
I'm here to remind you.

103
00:09:56.288 --> 00:09:58.800 line:-3
Since they've attacked Qibao Amber Tribe,

104
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.792 line:-4
I'm afraid your
Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon family...

105
00:10:01.792 --> 00:10:02.576 line:-3
Oh, no.

106
00:10:03.312 --> 00:10:04.720 line:-3
Notify your tribe immediately.

107
00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:05.984 line:-3
They won't give us a chance to prepare

108
00:10:05.984 --> 00:10:08.512 line:-3
once they've started.

109
00:10:08.512 --> 00:10:11.936 line:-4
Therefore, I've decided to move
the tribe into Tian Dou City

110
00:10:11.936 --> 00:10:13.744 line:-3
to seek protection under the empire.

111
00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.424 line:-3
Mr. Frander, Master, we're leaving.

112
00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:36.080 line:-3
Rong Rong, stay at school first.

113
00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.216 line:-3
Here's safe.

114
00:10:37.216 --> 00:10:38.992 line:-4
I'll come and get you
once everything is settled.

115
00:10:38.992 --> 00:10:40.416 line:-3
Dad,

116
00:10:41.696 --> 00:10:42.576 line:-3
I can do this.

117
00:10:42.576 --> 00:10:43.744 line:-3
Be a good girl.

118
00:11:05.424 --> 00:11:11.616 line:-4
2,000 disciples.
2,000 disciples have become corpses.

119
00:11:11.616 --> 00:11:16.400 line:-4
Martial Soul Hall,
I won't let you off easily.

120
00:11:36.662 --> 00:11:44.706 line:-3
[Soul Land]

121
00:11:48.832 --> 00:11:50.656 line:-3
In the battle with Qibao Amber Tribe,

122
00:11:50.656 --> 00:11:52.512 line:-3
a total of 10,000 soul masters were dispatched.

123
00:11:52.512 --> 00:11:55.280 line:-3
Including 1,000 soul masters of the Lower Four.

124
00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.664 line:-4
At least 4,000 of
our soul masters were sacrificed

125
00:11:57.664 --> 00:11:59.872 line:-3
and over 3,000 were injured.

126
00:11:59.872 --> 00:12:01.536 line:-3
Three of the four elders

127
00:12:01.536 --> 00:12:03.696 line:-3
were greatly hurt to different extents.

128
00:12:03.696 --> 00:12:06.192 line:-4
So, they had no choice
but to retreat temporarily.

129
00:12:06.192 --> 00:12:07.632 line:-3
Rubbish.

130
00:12:08.752 --> 00:12:11.872 line:-4
10,000 people were sent there
and it was a secret attack.

131
00:12:11.872 --> 00:12:14.528 line:-3
However, your losses doubled the opponents'.

132
00:12:15.776 --> 00:12:17.840 line:-4
What about the
Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon family?

133
00:13:30.952 --> 00:13:33.977 line:-3
[Blue]

134
00:14:07.568 --> 00:14:11.360 line:-3
Wu, it has been five years. How are you?

135
00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.408 line:-3
Finally, I'm here for you.

136
00:14:14.784 --> 00:14:16.144 line:-3
The teacher mentioned that

137
00:14:16.144 --> 00:14:18.784 line:-4
the center of Star Forest boasts
the most abundant soul power.

138
00:14:18.784 --> 00:14:20.448 line:-3
It's suitable for the cultivation of soul beasts.

139
00:14:20.448 --> 00:14:22.752 line:-3
So, the stronger the soul beast is,

140
00:14:22.752 --> 00:14:25.744 line:-3
the closer they stay near to the center.

141
00:14:25.744 --> 00:14:28.304 line:-3
As long as I go straight inwards,

142
00:14:28.304 --> 00:14:30.560 line:-3
I can find you for sure.

143
00:15:07.728 --> 00:15:09.504 line:-3
Is Er Long okay?

144
00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:15.248 line:-4
She's overwhelmed with sorrow.
Let her rest.

145
00:15:15.248 --> 00:15:16.176 line:-3
How about Mu Bai?

146
00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.440 line:-4
Except the Elephant Armoured Tribe,
the other three of the Lower Four

147
00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.728 line:-3
are all located in Xing Luo Empire.

148
00:15:21.728 --> 00:15:23.584 line:-3
Mu Bai and Zhu Qing went back to investigate,

149
00:15:23.584 --> 00:15:24.784 line:-3
and they just confirmed that

150
00:15:24.784 --> 00:15:28.544 line:-4
the Lower Four have already been controlled
by Martial Soul Hall.

151
00:15:29.296 --> 00:15:34.144 line:-4
Among the Upper Three, one has been hiding,
one destroyed, and the last one wiped out.

152
00:15:34.144 --> 00:15:36.176 line:-3
Every soul master is in danger.

153
00:15:36.176 --> 00:15:39.216 line:-4
Many individual soul masters have joined
Martial Soul Hall.

154
00:15:39.216 --> 00:15:41.856 line:-3
In addition to their own powerful strength,

155
00:15:41.856 --> 00:15:45.728 line:-4
they've controlled over 70% of
the soul masters across the whole continent.

156
00:15:45.728 --> 00:15:49.152 line:-3
Wiped out? Gang, your family...

157
00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:57.088 line:-3
It was too late when we reached home.

158
00:15:57.968 --> 00:16:02.208 line:-3
The whole tribe, over 1,800 people, died.

159
00:16:02.208 --> 00:16:05.477 line:-4
Only a few disciples
who were away survived.

160
00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:10.256 line:-4
Tian Dou Empire sent troops to help
bury the corpses immediately.

161
00:16:10.256 --> 00:16:14.256 line:-3
But the corpses were too many.

162
00:16:14.256 --> 00:16:16.768 line:-3
Our sect was looted.

163
00:16:16.768 --> 00:16:21.360 line:-4
My dad, as the Tribe Chief,
died without a complete body.

164
00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:26.160 line:-4
The three soul bones in his body
were forcibly ripped out.

165
00:16:30.048 --> 00:16:32.848 line:-3
Firstly, Qibao Amber Tribe.

166
00:16:32.848 --> 00:16:35.600 line:-4
And then,
the Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon family.

167
00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.536 line:-4
Martial Soul Hall attacked mercilessly
two times in a row.

168
00:16:37.536 --> 00:16:39.456 line:-3
Could their next target

169
00:16:39.456 --> 00:16:41.360 line:-3
be the two empires?

170
00:16:48.768 --> 00:16:52.032 line:-4
They've been dissatisfied
with their current situation

171
00:16:52.032 --> 00:16:54.240 line:-3
and longed to enhance their status.

172
00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.640 line:-3
Their current power

173
00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:59.712 line:-4
is strong enough to fight against
the two empires.

174
00:17:02.112 --> 00:17:05.552 line:-4
8,000 soul masters were sent to attack
the Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon family.

175
00:17:05.552 --> 00:17:08.000 line:-4
They were not discovered by the opponent
before attacking

176
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.400 line:-4
and successfully wiped out
all of them.

177
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.104 line:-3
We lost 3,000 people.

178
00:17:13.104 --> 00:17:17.712 line:-4
Ninth Elder and their Tribe Chief
died together.

179
00:17:17.712 --> 00:17:20.304 line:-3
The corpse has been brought back.

180
00:17:20.304 --> 00:17:23.616 line:-3
Great. The Upper Three lived up to their names.

181
00:17:23.616 --> 00:17:27.712 line:-4
Both of them are
indeed remarkable tribes.

182
00:17:27.712 --> 00:17:30.672 line:-3
They cost me 7,000 people.

183
00:17:30.672 --> 00:17:32.672 line:-3
Powerful enough.

184
00:17:32.672 --> 00:17:35.600 line:-3
Teacher, don't be angry.

185
00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.712 line:-3
Although our loss is heavy,

186
00:17:37.712 --> 00:17:40.192 line:-4
we've finally removed
the thorn in the flesh

187
00:17:40.192 --> 00:17:42.832 line:-3
and threatened the two empires.

188
00:17:42.832 --> 00:17:44.720 line:-3
We'll continue to accumulate power,

189
00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.408 line:-3
the two empires will surely be infiltrated by us.

190
00:17:47.408 --> 00:17:51.520 line:-4
We have to be careful
that they may retaliate.

191
00:17:53.088 --> 00:17:56.464 line:-4
Ask the Martial Soul Temple
in Tian Dou City to stay low.

192
00:17:56.464 --> 00:17:58.384 line:-3
Don't act rashly.

193
00:17:58.384 --> 00:18:02.800 line:-4
Monitor Tian Dou Empire and the remnants
of Qibao Amber Tribe at all times.

194
00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.136 line:-3
Inform me of anything suspicious.

195
00:18:06.032 --> 00:18:06.864 line:-3
Retreat.

196
00:18:06.864 --> 00:18:09.264 line:-3
Yes, Your Holiness.

197
00:18:13.024 --> 00:18:16.736 line:-3
Soul Hunting Manoeuvre stops here for now.

198
00:18:16.736 --> 00:18:20.816 line:-3
Next, the Penetration Plan should commence.

199
00:18:20.816 --> 00:18:23.792 line:-3
Proceed as planned.

200
00:18:55.357 --> 00:18:57.357 line:-4
[Since the commencement of
animating Soul Land on April 1st, 2017,]

[Appreciate your continuous

00:19:09.364 --> 00:19:11.364 line:-3
[we will definitely keep on striving.]

208
00:19:11.365 --> 00:19:13.365 line:-4
[Dream of Soul Land
illuminates our martial soul,]

209
00:19:13.366 --> 00:19:15.366 line:-3
[vibrant youth with your presence.]

210
00:20:15.808 --> 00:20:17.252 line:-4
[Next Episode]
Martial Soul Hall announced that

211
00:20:17.268 --> 00:20:19.360 line:-4
they'll find out
who destroyed the two tribes.

212
00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.407 line:-3
Who would care about the murderers?

213
00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:22.558 line:-3
What's your plan?

214
00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:25.288 line:-3
They may need some time to search.

215
00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:28.299 line:-3
Go and support them then.

216
00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:30.797 line:-4
The Blue Silver Plant, which has long lived
together with the powerful soul beasts,

217
00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:33.376 line:-3
has developed anxiety and fear.

218
00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.059 line:-3
We shouldn't simply wait here.

219
00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:36.592 line:-3
Something powerful and mysterious

220
00:20:36.592 --> 00:20:39.007 line:-3
must have come here in the forest.

221
00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:42.412 line:-4
It will definitely cause a great disturbance
in the soul master world.

222
00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:45.376 line:-3
There will be an arduous fight.
